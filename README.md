# webshop-react-typescript

A webshop prototype built with React and TypeScript. Assets utilized from [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat).

Keywords:

- TypeScript
- React Router
- React Hooks
- Redux
- Functional Components
- Selectors (reselect)
- async/await
- Twitter Bootstrap v3
- Prettier

Tested with NodeJS v12.14.0

Install and run using:

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Notes

This a prototype that could be improved in several ways, e.g:

- Use twitter bootstrap React components to produce HTML instead of using basic HTML syntax with classes- redux-persist to save the redux state to localstorage to enable persistent state after browser tab refresh

* load complete webshop item data to redux and avoid refetching on later page loads
